# WHILE - IS - DO

The `WHILE` statement evaluates if the condition given is positive. While it is, the code between the `WHILE` and `REPEAT` statements is repeatedly ran.

## Syntax:

```coffeescript
WHILE <CONDITION> DO
 #Code goes here
REPEAT
```

The `<CONDITION>` that you can use are the same as the [IF](if-is-then/) statement ones.
